 Using GraphTerm with R
*********************************************************************************

.. index:: R

The notebook mode of GraphTerm will work with ``R``, without any
additional software. GraphTerm can open files in ``R-markdown`` format
as a notebook, and also saves notebooks using the same format.
To display inline graphics, the following ``R`` packages need to be
installed: ``RCurl``, ``Cairo``, and ``png``.
(On Linux, the following additional libraries, or their equivalents,
may need to be installed: ``libcurl4-openssl-dev libcairo2-dev
libxt-dev``)

The R-markdown file ``$GTERM_DIR/notebooks/R-histogram.R.md" contains
a sample notebook.
